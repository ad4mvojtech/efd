## Voice, Tone and Style
# Voice
Kind and friendly: Any time I communicate I am always trying to be nice towards the other person.
I am always trying to respect the other person, assuming they will do the same. Sometimes, if the person seems interesting to me, I like to talk to them.I use friendly and kind voice that shows my interest and enthusiasm.
I always respect different opinions and perspectives. I am always trying to find a common ground. good listener 

People-Pleasing (unfortunately): When getting to the point, I tend to over explain my reasons. And all the circumstances that led to my decisions.
                      (Subconsciously, of course.)

Honest: I strive to be straightforward. I am learning how to say no and how to express even the negative opinions in polite way.
          I reckon everyone deserves honesty. Beating about the bush or making excuses is just wasting ones time

candid:
Caring: 
Curious: I love learning about new interesting things. I am always trying to ask questions, that help me better understand the topic. I listen actively to what others have to say
and share my own insight and experiences. I am open and willing to try new things. 

# Tone
Informal: I prefer a relaxed and informal tone that suits most situations and contexts. I use a conversational and casual language that gives me naturalness and authenticity. 
          I also use abbreviations, shortened words and slang words that give me friendliness and approachability. I do not care if I break some grammar rules, if it improves the fluency and expressiveness of my speech.
Personal:
Emotional: I like to convey my feelings and emotions through my tone. I use different intonations, pitches and loudness to show my mood and attitude. I also use emoticons, 
            exclamation marks and punctuation marks to emphasize my tone and give it more expression. I do not hide my emotions, but rather share them with others.
Neutral:

Over-sharing. Or maybe just sharing: I am a fan of people communicating their feelings. I think it’s calming when people hear, that it’s not just them feeling a certain way, and that it’s all right. That you can have fear and still do the thing you are afraid of.
              Sharing ones fears and worries can show others that we’re all humans. It sounds like a huge cliché, but I think this ability is in general still lacking.
Assertive: When needed, I am the one who asks the question or raises the complaint
Proffesional:
Creative:
Neutral:
supportive:
Kind: When I talk, 80% of the time I smile. I want others to know I listen to them. And that I’m interested in what they have to say. I also don’t jump to conclusions. 
      Instead, I remind myself that I don’t know what’s behind someone’s behaviour. So, I can’t judge them without understanding them first.


# Style:
I like to have things that are working together, when I create or just change the furniture in my room. 
Organised:


Don’t use ALL CAPS: When emphasising within body text, I usually use bold, sometimes italics, but not ALL CAPS. They sound like shouting…
Writing without certain diacticis:
Mixing english + czech together.
No vulgarism.
Don’t use emojis: My closest peers would often ask, why do I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak. But my messages lack intonation and mimics, thus they happen to be misinterpreted. 
          To avoid inducing this impression, I do actually use emojis with people who use them too. Or with those, who are not yet that close to me to not sound rude.

My own content style guide

I have spent my forming years mostly on academic earth of my high school, together with my teachers who majored in psychology, tutors whose passion was art and friends who experienced their first heartbreaks. So just like that, I became a therapist to my whole friend group, teaching them how to deal with their struggles and teaching myself how to relax and find peace in art, which was the only part of my life I didn’t need to excel in (or let’s just say I somehow accepted it… at least tried to.)

Voice

If I were to describe myself, I’d talk about the deepest parts together with smallest details about my life, just to make sure you completely understand me. (It might have something to do with my need for validation.)

Personal

I don’t like small talks. Small talks mean general conversations which is pretty much shallow and if I love something, then its depth. I don’t want to hear about today’s weather, tell me something about your childhood.

Honest

I’ve spent years trying to fit in, which resulted into abandonig myself. Today I strive to be my truest self and especially in the way I communicate.

Open-minded

I have always wanted people to feel safe and themselves around me. I am open to see new perspectives and there is no topic I would judge you for. Of course there are some differences now and then, but in that case we can just agree to disagree.

Tone

Friendly

The last thing I want is for people to feel that they are not welcome around me. Even though I often act introverted or distanced, I am always open to friendly one-on-one conversation.

Comforting

My friends often say I act as both their parent or lifelong partner. Do you need to talk about your problem in the tiniest detail and then replay it ten times or do you just need someone to make you a cup of tea and listen to you? I can do both and I am happy to do so.

Direct

When it comes down to business, I express my needs and expectations without beating around the bush. I’m open about what my goals and vision is and I’m not afraid to be assertive. I’ve learned that at the end of the day, it’s a win-win for both sides.

Style

Detailed

Some may say it’s oversharing, overexplaining or even people-pleasing. Maybe it’s all of the above, but I always try to convey as much detial as possible to avoid some kind of misunderstanding.

Ask questions

My closest friends know that I ask them how they feel at least three times a week. And also how is their day, their work, if they got that A from their exam that we studied for together and so on. And I always ask How do yo feel? instead of How are you?

Polite

I don’t separate formal and informal communication when it comes to politeness. I treat the other person as I wish them to treat me. I don’t influence the other person’s reaction, but I can influence my own action. So it should always be human.
