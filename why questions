Why?
It’s simple and fast way of answering when they don’t have time to respond.

Why? 
They might be overloaded with work, or they are hanging out with someone else, so they might just wanna let you know that they’ve read your message.

Why? They don’t wanna get interrupted with what they are doing rn or they wanna be still fully focused on the present with someone else there and it might be rude to be on the phone.

Sometimes people might be just too busy, so they answer you a ‘’ok’’ message, meaning that they’ve read it and will look into it later. Sometimes they will answer with a ‘’ok’’ to let you know that they are not interested in continuing the conversation/ arguing. 

Whatever the case is, the word okay is one the most used phrases in the world, and everyone will understand what you mean.
