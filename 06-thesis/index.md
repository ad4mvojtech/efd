 # Hey there! 
I would like to show you a quick rundown of my bachelor thesis. 
Since I will be postponing my graduation, I would like to tell you atleast a bit about my theoretical part,this part is already done and ready. 
The topic for my bachelor thesis is modern technolgies used for 2D animation.

 ## What is 2D animation?
The basic definition of 2D animation consists of animation techniques that are created in only two dimensions, the x and y axes. However, if I could simplify the definition of 2D animation as much as possible, I would say that it is the art of creating motion in a two-dimensional space on the x and y axes, where the animator creates characters, various creatures and shapes, effects but also objects and backgrounds. 

Animation is an illusion for the human eye, which is unable to register rapidly changing images. The illusion of movement is created when a fast moving image is created by composing individual drawings in succession. One second is most often divided into 24 frames, which ensures that the animation moves smoothly. Depending on the style of animation and where the final product goes, up to 24 drawings per second can be created. 

The process of 2D animation (sometimes referred to as traditional animation) has undergone a long evolution from hand-drawn techniques to the use of digital methods using specialized computer software such as Toon Boom Harmony, MOHO, and Adobe After Effects. These digital programs save animators time and production costs, resulting in a more unique and faster final 2D animation.

Now, let’s take a quick look what has been before all these modern solutions took place:

## traditional vs. digital
We've come a long way in the evolution of animation. I mean, can you even believe there was a time when each frame of an animated character was drawn by hand? Well, believe it or not, it happened, and yes, it still happens in some cases. 

People who draw their animation characters by hand are dubbed Traditional Animators. Thanks to the introduction of computers and, of course, animation in computer systems for ushering in the era of Digital Animators.

Traditional animation or classical animation, cel animation, hand-drawn animation, or 2D animation is an animation technique in which each frame is drawn through a traditional medium. It was the dominant form of animation in cinema until computer animation was invented.

And now to the new world of digital animation! Digital animation is the process used by digital animators for digitally generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation only refers to moving images.

Digital animation is essentially a successor to stop motion techniques using 3D models and traditional animation techniques using frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations.

Digital animation is often faster, cheaper, and more flexible than traditional animation, as it allows for easy editing, coloring, and compositing. However, it can also lose some of the charm and warmth of hand-drawn animation, and require more technical skills and equipment.

## Tablets
he best drawing tablets for animation unlocks an entire new world of creativity. Whether you're a 3D animator or your passion lies in motion capture and graphics, there are plenty of excellent drawing tablets for animation on the market from big names like Wacom, Huion, Xencelabs and XP-Pen. But if you're new to these types of tablet or want an upgrade on your current one, it can be tricky to find the right tablet to suit your budget and artistic needs.

The Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium Bundle is the best drawing tablet for animation overall. Xencelabs is one of the newer brands making high-quality tablets for animation, and it has a newer SE model just released that comes in a sleek white finish.

So what is Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium Bundle? It's the full works in a box; it comes with the Xencelabs Pen Tablet, two pens (the 3 button and Thin Pen) and a case, a Quick Key remote with 40 programmable buttons, and other add-ons, such as the drawing glove and spare nibs. In our Xencelabs Pen Tablet Medium review our writer found this tablet to be "portable, wireless and pretty much flawless in performance".

This isn't as large as the Wacom Cintiq 16, coming in at 13-inches the Xencelabs fits neatly with an Apple MacBook or iPad Pro – demonstrating its mobile credentials. This is a graphics tablet, not a pen display or computer tablet, so you'll need a device to plug it into. The quality is excellent and the bundle of goodies really sets you up for work – the Quick Key remote is a particular life-saver.

Need more than just a drawing tablet? Thanks to massive improvements in its stylus technology and display sensitivity, our testing judged that Apple's iPad is now a serious contender in the drawing tablet market, and the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro is top of the range. Not only is it one of the best tablets ever, it's also a serious tool for animators, whether you want to use as a stand-alone tablet or hook it up to your computer as a pen display.

Our tester found that the new M2 chip makes this tablet an absolute powerhouse, with ultra-fast performance that essentially puts this iPad on the level of a MacBook. The mini-LED powered XDR display is also best-in-class, with 1,600 nits of peak brightness, 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness, greater contrast and better control of local dimming.

For animators who like to use Procreate Dreams, the 12.9-inch M2 iPad Pro is the best iPad for Procreate. The screen is fantastic for sketching, and its responsiveness means it works incredibly well with Procreate Dreams. Drawing with the Apple Pencil also feels fantastic, with incredible sensitivity and that unmistakable Apple design that makes it comfortable to use in the hand.

Of course, since this is an Apple product, you already know what the downside is. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch M2 is a very expensive tablet, and if you don't need its blistering, top-of-the-line performance, there are options on this list to suit smaller budgets. But if you can afford it, you won't regret it.

The best drawing tablet for animation from Wacom is the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16. This large pen computer and display runs full versions of software, including Maya and high end 3D software, so you can run task-heavy apps without breaking a sweat.

For digital artists who work in 3D, the larger screen version of the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 is the best option for you. Measuring 15.6 inches, the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 has an impressive power and performance, although its battery life could be better. It's a little heavy too, but it comes with a built-in stand for easy designing and sketching with its accompanying stylus.

# 12 principles of animation

Disney's twelve basic principles of animation were introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation. The principles are based on the work of Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, in their quest to produce more realistic animation.

So what are the 12 Principles of Animation?

1. Squash and Stretch - importantly, the volume of the object does not change when it is squeezed or stretched
2. Anticipation - pre-movement before the event)
3. Staging - the aim is to direct the audience's attention and clarify what is most important in the scene, the rule of thirds applies, e.g. more space where one looks or where one runs
4. Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose - keyframes/positions of figures are important in animation, always think about and draw a few keyframes/positions first and then fill in the intervals later
5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action - ("Overlapping action" is the tendency for body parts to move with different proportions. A related technique is "overlapping". For example, on a person's body, the torso with arms, legs, and head start moving earlier and faster, and hair, clothing, or body parts with a lot of tissue (fat belly and breasts, loose skin) are more prone to move more slowly or even independently. It is true that an exaggerated use of technique can produce a comic effect, while more realistic animation must time precise execution to produce a convincing result.
6. Slow In and Slow Out - The motion of the human body and most other objects takes time to speed up and slow down. For this reason, the animation looks more realistic if it has more drawings near the beginning and end of the action and if we emphasize extreme (key) poses.
7. Arc - The most natural action tends to follow an arched trajectory, e.g. when walking, our head should form an undulating trajectory. The exception is mechanical e.g. robotic motion, which usually moves in straight lines.)
8. Secondary Action - Adding secondary actions to the main action makes the scene more lively. A person walking can simultaneously throw their hands, hold them in their pockets, talk or whistle, or express emotion through facial expressions. The important thing is that the secondary activities emphasize the main one and do not distract.
9. Timing - Timing refers to the number of drawings or frames for a given action, which translates into the speed and impact of the film. There should be different speeds in the film depending on the action or the weight of the object, for example.
10. Exaggeration - The exaggeration effect is particularly useful because animated movements that strive to mimic reality perfectly can look static and boring.
11. Solid drawing - The animator must be a skilled artist and understand the basics of three-dimensional shapes, anatomy, weight, balance, light and shadow, etc. The animator's job involves acting (acting out movement, scenes) and the animator should still be drawing.
12. Appeal - Charisma, attractiveness. The character should be likeable to the viewer. Villains or monsters can also be attractive - the important thing is that the viewer feels that the character is real and interesting, the viewer must be won over and the viewer must root for the character. There are a few tricks that allow the character to connect better with the audience, to make the viewer empathize with the character. The child's face in particular bears sympathetic traits.




# Integration of 3D elements
2D animation is created when we combine different images with different heights and widths, which creates the illusion of movement in a two-dimensional world lacking depth.

3D animation is generated from three-dimensional moving images in 3D computer software. Such images can not only be scaled, but also rotated and shown from different perspectives, giving the impression of depth and space.

Of the most obvious advantages, especially for companies that don’t have multi-million dollar budgets like Pixar or Disney, is that 2D animation is cheaper than 3D animation.

For this reason there is more movement in 2D animation than in 3D.

Another plus – in 2D animation, audiences will accept more abstract elements than in 3D. You can afford more freedom to modify characters, colors, and objects.

The definite advantage of 3D is the ability to show products in 3D. Therefore, 3D animations are mainly chosen by technology companies or manufacturers of electronic equipment and cars. They want to showcase the details of the equipment’s construction or design. This gives them a more realistic image than with 2D animation.

Hybrid animation allows you to combine the advantages of 2D and 3D.

Derald Hunt helped animate the “Tomb Raider” games featuring Lara Croft, among others. Most of the character animations were done in 3D. However, when the creators wanted to incorporate more movement into the scene, 2D animation proved more effective.

A great example of combining 2D and 3D animation for a better end result is the animated series “Arcane” (2019). Based on the computer game by Riot Games – French animation studio Fortiche Productions was co-developer of the series.

More than 80 animators worked on the animations. It mixed different styles and techniques including 2D and 3D animation. The characters and some of the effects are animated in 3D. On the other side, 2D was used to give texture to specific elements. Therefore, water, smoke, fire or dust were shown in 2D. The background of the animation was also in 2D.
