Usually when I ask someone about something that is important to me , I assume they will come up with a normal answer, telling me more than just one basic ok. 
Maybe I am too sensitive, maybe not, however it upsets me and It creates this question that I  ask myself and that’s if everything’s alright. 
The word okay can be used in so many scenarios.

Consider this: you're engaged in a conversation, and instead of engaging with you, the response is a curt 'ok.' It's like a punctuation mark that leaves you questioning the intention behind it. Is it indifference, agreement, or sign to acknowledge receipt?
