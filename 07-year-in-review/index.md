# Year in Review

2023/2024

Insights, things I learned, etc.

- ## school
  I was really on the edge of quitting once again, but since I am this close to having my bachelor degree, I told myself that I need to step up my game, focus and get things done.
  Maybe the quality might not be as good, but it's still better to do something than waste my time doing nothing meaningful. I feel like I only had a couple subjects that really gave me something. University for me is really mainly about finding myself and what I want to do in life. We are still young people who need to find themselves instead of knowing precisely who they are. 
    
- ## personal
In the past year I've learned that people in our lives come and go. Some will stay and some will leave. Your loved ones, your friends, relationships and so on. I've worked on letting things take their natural path and not hold on to them and let them bring me down. I gravitated to the thought that what is meant for me will stay and I apply it in many aspects of my life ever since. 
  
- ## free time
 I have started focusing more on myself. I wanted to dress better, look better. Do better. Be a better person. Focus more on what I eat and how many times a day I eat. I also wanted to start doing gymnastics in my free time and sort some friendships out. I have done many of these things, yet there is still a long way to go. Nothing will ever be perfect and I need to learn how to be okay with that. 

I would also like to focus on things that are really fullfilling. Things that really push me and feel nice.
