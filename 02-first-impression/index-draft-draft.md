## something about me


My interesterest are revolving around things that inspire me. I like aesthetically pleasing things.
I am trying to see beauty in everyday stuff. It is very hard to describe myself in just a few sentences. 
It is your turn now to make an opinion about me.  
<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

I love a good cup of coffee and tattoos of any kind. I enjoy playing fps games, I occasionally go to gym, spend time with friends, have a deep talks about life. When I am not studying, I am working as customer care specialist. It is very tiring work, cause all you do is take care of people who don not know how to do 3 simple clicks.

I would say I am still trying to figure out what I want to do in life. 

## Featured Projects
Since I still do not know what I wanna do in the future, I am trying a bit of everything. 

Here are some examples of my work:

## GRAPHICS
I really enjoy working with bright colours, here is an example of a random picture from pinterest that I have edited.

The pictures on the left show some mock-up print designs for the T-shirt. This is just a draft, nothing finished.

Here is how the mockup of the tshirt could look in real life.
