# Voice, Tone and Style
## Voice

Kind, Friendly: Any time I communicate I am always trying to be nice towards the other person.
I am always trying to respect the other person, assuming they will do the same. 

People-Pleasing: When getting to the point, I tend to over explain my reasons. And all the circumstances that led to my decisions.

Candid: I am sort of a candid observer, usually more listening to other people and being honest in my conversation with them.

Divagate: my storytelling is often interrupted by random details I remembered or I forget where I was going with the conversation.

Personal: I don’t like small talks. Small talks mean general conversations which is pretty much shallow and if I love something, then its depth. I don’t want to hear about today’s weather, tell me something about your childhood.

## Tone

Informal: I prefer a relaxed and informal tone that suits most situations and contexts. I use a conversational and casual language that gives me naturalness and authenticity. 

Emotional: I like to convey my feelings and emotions through my tone. I use different intonations, pitches and loudness to show my mood and attitude. I also use exclamation marks and punctuation marks to emphasize my tone and give it more expression. It is really hard for me to hide my emotions. 

Over-sharing. Or maybe just sharing: I am a fan of people communicating their feelings. I think it’s calming when people hear, that it’s not just them feeling a certain way, and that it’s all right. 

Assertive: When needed, I am the one who asks the question or raises the complaint.


## Style:

Don’t use ALL CAPS: When emphasising within body of a text,I never use ALL CAPS. It seems to me, that it seems as if the text is shouting.
Writing without certain diacticis: When I am texting a friend I might use the fastest way to type a certain information. 
Usually without diacritics.

No use emojis:  I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak. But my messages lack intonation and mimics, thus they happen to be misinterpreted.

Detailed: Some may say it’s oversharing, overexplaining or even people-pleasing. Maybe it’s all of the above, but I always try to convey as much detial as possible to avoid some kind of misunderstanding.

Also Mixing english + czech together. And lastly no vulgarism.
