# Voice, Tone and Style
## Voice

Kind and friendly: Any time I communicate I am always trying to be nice towards the other person.
I am always trying to respect the other person, assuming they will do the same. 
Sometimes, if the person seems interesting to me, I like to talk to them.I use friendly and kind voice that shows my interest and enthusiasm.
I always respect different opinions and perspectives. I am always trying to find a common ground. good listener 

People-Pleasing: When getting to the point, I tend to over explain my reasons. And all the circumstances that led to my decisions.

Candid – I am sort of a candid observer, usually more listening to other people and being honest in my conversation with them.

Divagate – my storytelling is often interrupted by random details I remembered or I forget where I was going with the conversation.

Personal: I don’t like small talks. Small talks mean general conversations which is pretty much shallow and if I love something, then its depth. I don’t want to hear about today’s weather, tell me something about your childhood.

## Tone
Informal: I prefer a relaxed and informal tone that suits most situations and contexts. I use a conversational and casual language that gives me naturalness and authenticity. 
          
Personal: I am used to keep the circle of my friends small, so when I am along my friends I am being completely myself, cause I know that they would not judge me.

Emotional: I like to convey my feelings and emotions through my tone. I use different intonations, pitches and loudness to show my mood and attitude. I also use exclamation marks and punctuation marks to emphasize my tone and give it more expression. It is really hard for me to hide my emotions. 

Over-sharing. Or maybe just sharing: I am a fan of people communicating their feelings. I think it’s calming when people hear, that it’s not just them feeling a certain way, and that it’s all right. That you can have fear and still do the thing you are afraid. Sharing ones fears and worries can show others that we’re all humans. It sounds like a huge cliché, but I think this ability is in general still lacking.

Assertive: When needed, I am the one who asks the question or raises the complaint
Kind: When I talk, especially to strangers I am always trying to be nice and kind. I want others to know I listen to them. And that I’m interested in what they have to say. I also don’t jump to conclusions. Instead, I remind myself that I don’t know what’s behind someone’s behaviour. 

Friendly: The last thing I want is for people to feel that they are not welcome around me. Even though I often act introverted or distanced, I am always open to friendly one-on-one conversation.

Comforting: My friends often say I act as both their parent or lifelong partner. Do you need to talk about your problem in the tiniest detail and then replay it ten times or do you just need someone to make you a cup of tea and listen to you? I can do both and I am happy to do so.


## Style:
Organised: I like to have things that are working together, when I create or just change the furniture in my room. 

Don’t use ALL CAPS: When emphasising within body of a text,I never use ALL CAPS. It seems to me, that it gives off a shouting vibe…
Writing without certain diacticis:
Mixing english + czech together. No vulgarism.
No use emojis:  I sound so mad when texting. I write the same as I speak. But my messages lack intonation and mimics, thus they happen to be misinterpreted.

Detailed: Some may say it’s oversharing, overexplaining or even people-pleasing. Maybe it’s all of the above, but I always try to convey as much detial as possible to avoid some kind of misunderstanding.

Ask questions: My closest friends know that I ask them how they feel at least three times a week. And also how is their day, their work, if they got that A from their exam that we studied for together and so on. And I always ask How do yo feel? instead of How are you?
