# Hello there!!

My name’s Adam, I’m an junior animator based in Prague. I can speak Czech, English and German & I also study French.

If you’d like to see some of my work, here’s a link to my portfolio:

## … and here’s something about me:)

My interests are eclectic and draw inspiration from various sources. I appreciate aesthetics and find beauty in the ordinary. Describing myself in a few sentences is a challenge, so now it's your turn to form an opinion.

A good cup of coffee and a variety of tattoos always capture my interest. I indulge in playing FPS games, hit the gym occasionally, socialize with friends, and engage in deep conversations about life. When not immersed in my studies, I work as a customer care specialist, a demanding role that involves assisting people with simple tasks that may be challenging for them.

I am currently in the process of figuring out my path in life.
