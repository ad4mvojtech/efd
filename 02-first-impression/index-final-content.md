My interesterest are revolving around things that inspire me. I like aesthetically pleasing things. I am trying to see beauty in everyday stuff. It is very hard to describe myself in just a few sentences. It is your turn now to make an opinion about me.

I love a good cup of coffee and tattoos of any kind. I enjoy playing fps games, I occasionally go to gym, spend time with friends, have a deep talks about life. When I am not studying, I am working as customer care specialist. It is very tiring work, cause all you do is take care of people who don not know how to do 3 simple clicks.

I would say I am still trying to figure out what I want to do in life.
